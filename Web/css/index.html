The are three places where we can write css codes:

1. Element level (which is similar to html formatting) - affects only a particular element
2. Document level (using <script> tag)					- affects the entire document
3. External level (creating a separate .css file)		- affects dependend documents


1. Inline CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. External CSS
