	Data Structure
		Data Structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can 
		be used effectively. The most basics examples are arrays and strings.
	
	Abstract Data Type (ADT)
		The abstract datatype is a special kind of datatype, whose behaviour is defined by a
		set of values and set of operations.

	Why did we use array?
	
	Prerequsite for array: Loops
	
	Basic variable - primitive types - e.g. int, char (datatype already built into a language)
	
	Array variable - derived types - e.g. array, pointer etc
	
	int array, float array, double array - mostly works on the same principle
	
	char array are different from the above so that they become suitable for taking string
	inputs.
	
	char[]
	string - Abstract Data Type
